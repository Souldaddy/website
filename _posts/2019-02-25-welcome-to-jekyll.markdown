Picking a new website hosting interface for the Pack.

Started with doing a Wordpress site. But after just a few days things were out date with Wordpress and I don't think I will have the time
to keep up with all the security updates needed.
There are static Wordpress site generators but it still seems way overkill for doing a simple site.

Looking at other static site generators Jekyll is a major one. It is based on Ruby which I don't use but it seems like it is just under
the hood for the most part where I won't have to touch it much.
It also has a free hosting option on [Github Pages][gh-pages] which seems atractive. Along with [custom domain support][gh-dns].
