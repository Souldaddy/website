This is our only fundraising activity to pay for Pack activities for the entire year.
This year is a big adjustment for us since it will not be possible to do our normal store front sales locations this year.

[**Free shipping** for online orders over $40.](https://www.trails-end.com/) On the Trails End website enter in your Scout's name and zipcode to credit your Scout with the sale to help them reach their fundraising goals.

[Sales Form](https://www.sdicbsa.org/Popcorn/Docs/1PageOrderForm2020.pdf) for friends, family and neighboors you can contact your scout's family directly to arrange for local delivery options.
