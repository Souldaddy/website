## Covid Update
In 2020 we are still experimenting on how to handle the ever changing regulations and rules for meetings and events.

Dens **can have** in person meetings as long as they are outdoors, with masks and hand sanitizer.
Each Den may have their own combination of in person and virtual meetings.

Pack meetings will start the school year with virtual events. TBD second Tuesday of each month at 6:30pm during the school year.

## Membership

**Potential new members** are encouraged to meet the Pack and Dens and learn about upcoming activities.

Grades K-5 all genders are welcomed to join our Pack.
